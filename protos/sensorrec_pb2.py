# Auto-generated placeholder for Python protobuf (proto/sensor_record.proto)
# Note: This is a minimal hand-written helper to parse frames using google.protobuf.
# For full compatibility you should run:
#   protoc --python_out=. proto/sensor_record.proto
#
# The generated file is large; this placeholder only ensures tooling won't crash.
print("NOTE: For accurate parsing, run protoc to generate sensorrec_pb2.py from proto/sensor_record.proto")
